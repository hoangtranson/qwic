# Intro

This test must be done in Node.js. We will run a series of automatic tests to validate the logic but feel free to add your own
unit tests. For any doubts please send me an e-mail at hmartins@qwic.nl

## Factory Managment
In our factory, you are responsible for planning the usage of assembly line for our Supply Chain. â€‹
Therefore you've decided to organize things a bit by planning everybodyâ€™s tasks. The logic is simple: 
the higher the number of bikes which can be assembled, the more people you can satisfy.

### Rules
Sales People give you the starting day of their production cycle and the number of consecutive days they need to reserve 
the assembly line.

- For example:

| Production  | Starting Day | Duration |
| :------------ |:---------------| :-----|
| A | 02-01-2018 | 5 |
| B | 09-01-2018 | 7 |
| C | 15-01-2018 | 6 |
| D | 09-01-2018 | 3 |

- Production A starts on day 2 and ends on day 6

- Production B starts on day 9 and ends on day 15

- Production C starts on day 15 and ends on day 20

- Production D starts on day 9 and ends on day 11

In this example, itâ€™s not possible to carry out all the productions because the periods for B and C overlap. 
3 productions maximum can be carried out: A, D and C.

### Constraints

startingDay > current date

0 < quantity of possible schedules < 100000

0 < duration < 1000

### Examples

#### Input
```
[
        {
		"startingDay": "2018-01-02T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 5
	},
	{
		"startingDay": "2018-01-09T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 7
	},
	{
		"startingDay": "2018-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 6
	},
	{
		"startingDay": "2018-01-09T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 3
	}
]
```
#### Output
```
{
    "productionCycle" : 3
}
```
#### Input
```
[
        {
		"startingDay": "2018-01-03T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 5
	},
	{
		"startingDay": "2018-01-09T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 2
	},
	{
		"startingDay": "2018-01-24T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 5
	},
	{
		"startingDay": "2018-01-16T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 9
	},
	{
		"startingDay": "2018-01-11T00:00:00.000Z",
		"duration": 6
	}

]
```
#### Output
```
{
    "productionCycle" : 4
}
```
